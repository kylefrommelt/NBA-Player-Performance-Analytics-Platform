 Focus on minutes correlation when evaluating props
Consider player consistency scores when making picks
Pay attention to rest patterns and home/away splits
Defense quality has minimal impact - don't overweight matchups


Gradient Boosting (high performance with tabular data)
Ensemble methods (given the different types of patterns)
Neural Networks (for complex pattern recognition)

1. Feature Engineering:
   - Create composite features from minutes + role combinations
   - Add rolling averages (7-day, 14-day, 30-day)
   - Engineer "form" indicators based on consistency patterns

2. Data Preparation:
   - Split data into training/validation/test sets by date
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables (teams, positions, roles)

3. Target Variable Selection:
   - Consider binary classification (over/under)
   - Or regression for exact values
   - Possibly multi-class for ranges


   Focus on recent form metrics as they show the strongest predictive power
2. Consider role-based analysis when evaluating players
Don't overweight rest days in analysis
Address missing data issues, particularly in matchup statistics
Monitor the high-consistency players (38) more closely for potential opportunities
